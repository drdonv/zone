A focused deep work application that helps you commit to tasks and track your progress through structured sessions.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Contract** - Define your task, duration, and completion criteria
2. **Enter Focus Mode** - Full-screen distraction-free environment with a countdown timer
3. **Reflect** - After the session, record what you accomplished
4. **Review History** - Track your past sessions and progress

Sessions persist across page reloads, so you can safely refresh without losing your progress.

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** with **TypeScript** - UI framework with type safety
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **localStorage** - Client-side session persistence
